A neural network writen enteirly in python relying soley on numpy to function.
This network will attempt digit recognition to dicern the handwritten digits
(0-9) presetned as 28x28 images. In order to test this we will be using the 
MNIST datasets for training and testing.

Shows a good understanding of the foundations of marchine learning, I wanted to
make sure that I truly understood how neural networks works and I though that
the best way to do this would be to build one from scratch essentailly using
only numpy and linear algebra.
